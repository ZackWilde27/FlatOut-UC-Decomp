# FlatOut Ultimate Carnage Decompilation

My on-going decompilation of FlatOut Ultimate Carnage

I would say it's the collector's edition but they didn't change the exe file so I may as well be decompiling the original version

My main priority is <a href="https://github.com/ZackWilde27/FlatOut-2-decomp/">FlatOut 2</a>, but a lot of the work I'm doing over there applies here so I can at least help get the ball rolling.

Fouc.exe.gzf is the current Ghidra zip file, for anyone wanting to help with the project
